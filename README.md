                GroupShareClient.AllScopes);

## Documentation

### RestAPIs

Please see http://gs2017dev.sdl.com:41234/documentation/api/index#/ for details about the GroupShare Rest API.
Please see http://gs2017dev.sdl.com:41235/docs/ui/index#/ for details about the Translation Memory Service.

### GS kit configuration

Due to a problem in the GroupShare (MultiTerm) RestAPI, you may encounter issues with creationDate of termbases being parsed incorrectly.
As a workaround, set environment variable multiterm.dateFormatStr according to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.
(Reference: LTGS-9908 - Multiterm RestAPI returns non-ISO datetime format.)

## Build

GroupShareKit is a single assembly designed to be easy to deploy anywhere. If you prefer to compile it yourself, you'll need:

*Visual Studio 2017
*Windows 10 to build and test windows store projects

To clone it locally click the "Clone in Desktop" button above or run the following git commands:

```
http://gs2017dev.sdl.com:41234/documentation/api/index#/
cd groupsharekit.net
.\build.cmd
```
## Contribute

You can clone this repository locally from GitHub using the "Clone in Desktop" 
button from the main project site, or run this command in the Git Shell:

`git clone git@github.com:sdl/groupsharekit.net.git`

If you want to make contributions to the project, 
[forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) is the 
easiest way to do this. 

After doing that, run the `.\build.cmd` script at the root of the repository 
to ensure all the tests pass.

### Running integration tests

#### General setup

GroupShareKit has integration tests that access the GroupShare Rest API, but they must be 
configured before they will be executed.

**Note:** To run the tests, we highly recommend you create a test GroupShare
account (i.e., don't use your real GroupShare account) and a test organization
owned by that account. Then set the following environment variables:

`GROUPSHAREKIT_USERNAME` (set this to the test account's username)
`GROUPSHAREKIT_PASSWORD` (set this to the test account's password)
`GROUPSHAREKIT_TESTORGANIZATION` (set this to the test account's organization PATH)
`GROUPSHAREKIT_SERVERNAME` (set this to your sql server name)
`GROUPSHAREKIT_BASEURI` (set this to the url of your GroupShare instance)
`GROUPSHAREKIT_BEARERID` (optional, set to additional BearerId added to requests. If not provided, default connection is used)

Once these are set, the integration tests will be executed both when 
running the IntegrationTests MSBuild target, and when running the 
Sdl.Community.GroupShareKit.Tests.Integration assembly through an xUnit.net-friendly test runner.

#### Additional TerminologyClient tests setup

Since the GroupShare (MultiTerm) RestAPI has no support for creating termbases, some more manual setup is required to successfully run the TerminologyClient tests:
In MultiTerm Desktop, create a termbase:
* In "Termbase Definition" step use the option "Use a predefined termbase template": "Bilingual glossary"
* (Friendly) Name: "testTB"
* Organization: the organization created for these tests
* rest: use defaults, do not change anything
